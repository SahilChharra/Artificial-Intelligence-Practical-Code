# Artificial-Intelligence-Practical-Code
This Repository contains source code for AI Lab Practicals of CSE RCOEM 6th Sem

List of Practical :-

1. Write a program to solve Tic-Tac-Toe without implemantation of any specific AI algorithm.

2. Write a program to implement the two water jug problem to understand the state space search.

3. Write a program to implement Breadth First Search. Take a graph and start/goal node an input. Your job is to find goal node. Print the total cost and path

4. Write a program to implement A* to solve 8-Puzzle problem

5. Write a program to solve Tic-Tac-Toe by using Min-Max algorithm and alpha-beta prunning.

6. Write a program to implement K nearest neighbor algorithm. Randomly generate a data of 20 points having x and y values. Also assign positive values when x or y component is below 26 and negative values to all other input data. Perform classification by using value of K=1,2,3,4,5.
